-- Seed data for SharedListsApp development
-- This file is run after migrations to populate initial data

-- Note: In a real application, you might want to seed with:
-- - Default user profiles
-- - Sample lists for testing
-- - Initial CRDT snapshots

-- For now, this file is empty as we'll create data through the application
-- You can add sample data here for development if needed

-- Example of how you might seed sample data:
-- INSERT INTO user_profiles (user_id, display_name) VALUES 
--   ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 'Test User 1'),
--   ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002', 'Test User 2');
